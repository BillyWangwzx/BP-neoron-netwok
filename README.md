This is my really first introduce to neural networks. Instead of using Pytorch, keras, Tensorflow, I eager to build my own neural networks.
This work is a simple full connected neural networks uses a Class to define layer. So it's pretty easy to change the number of layers using this program.
This code only uses Numpy package.
Writing this code on my own helps me get a better understanding of the back propagation and CLASS in python. I think this is a pretty good start for me.
